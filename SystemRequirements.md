## Browsers ##

The Voynichese web-based query application is tested and compatible with the following browser versions:

  * Google Chrome 33+ (recommended)
  * Firefox 28+
  * Safari 6+
  * Internet Explorer 11+

Note that certain features, such as folio image filter options, are not available in all browsers. For best results, the Google Chrome browser is recommended.

Additionally, the query viewer is optimized for a screen width of at least 800 pixels.

A minimum of 1Gb of memory (RAM) is also recommended, preferably more given how memory-intensive browser based image manipulation can be.
