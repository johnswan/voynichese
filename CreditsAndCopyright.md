# EVA Font #

The EVA font used in the project is derived from the original EVA font by Ren√© Zandbergen and Gabriel Landini, processed to remove unused glyphs and reduce font size.

To learn more about the EVA font see [this page](http://www.voynich.nu/extra/eva.html).

# Transcriptions #

The EVA transcriptions used in the Voynichese project were obtained from the [Voynich Information Browser](http://voynich.freie-literatur.de/) with contributions from different authors, including Takeshi Takahashi and Jorge Stolfi.

The classification of folios into [languages A and B](http://www.voynich.nu/extra/lang.html) is derived from the work of Capt. Prescott Currier, also extracted using the [Voynich Information Browser](http://voynich.freie-literatur.de/).
